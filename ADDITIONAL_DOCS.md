Additional documentation for using homogeneous robot arms as teleoperators has been added to the project:

1. Created a detailed guide in `docs/homogeneous_teleop.md` explaining how to use homogeneous robot arms as teleoperators
2. Added a README file in `src/lerobot/teleoperators/jakaS12_leader/` describing the Jaka S12 teleoperator implementation
3. Created example files in `examples/jakaS12_teleop/` demonstrating usage:
   - Main example script (`jakaS12_teleop_example.py`)
   - Configuration example (`config.py`)
   - README with usage instructions (`README.md`)
